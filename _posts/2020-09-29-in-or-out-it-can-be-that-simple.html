<p>At my work, we develop goals on a quarterly cadence, and we do so pretty thoughtfully in order to limit our focus on what the key achievements we're striving for are.</p>
<p>This works great for me; <a href="https://rosemaryorchard.com">Rosemary Orchard</a> and I have spoken numerous times of the twelve week year on <a href="https://nestedfolderspodcast.com">Nested Folders</a>. What gets me every time, though, are the all-the-other-things: projects that might be needed or wanted, but which aren't in service of my goals.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I think a lot about how full everyone's days are. We consume content and ideas in all our waking hours. Anything we do is not just a thing we have chosen, but also a signal of something we have forgone. Silly finite time.</p>
<p>In consideration of all of this, I now have two root folders in my task management system:</p>
<ol>
<li>Goals</li>
<li>Distractions</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously, goals contains the (small) number of projects and their associated tasks that map back to my goals. Everything else goes in Distractions.</p>
<p>Now, this doesn't mean that I don't work on projects or skip taking action on tasks inside the Distractions folder. I'd love to, but that isn't practical.</p>
<p>What it does mean, though, is that I am reminded at every turn that a step towards project in Distractions is a step away from outcomes in Goals.</p>
<p>Choices have consequences, and I need to make sure I remember that. It might seem harsh to call critical things distractions, but left unchecked, the urgent and the critical will eat my goals for lunch.</p>
