<p>It’s day five of my series of posts about the wonderful addition of Shortcuts automation in <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/ios/">OmniFocus 3.4 for iOS</a>, and I’ve saved the big one for last. Today’s Shortcut is something that is, for me, a really useful tool for creating an ongoing diary of my life.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/bf384e7ac96342d28e5781398ba87965">This Daily Journal shortcut</a> creates a rich text (from markdown) summary of the day, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>weather conditions and high/low temperatures</li>
<li>OmniFocus actions due (or overdue) today</li>
<li>OmniFocus actions which are flagged and available</li>
<li>OmniFocus actions which are tagged with the forecast tag and available</li>
<li>a list of calendar events</li>
<li>a list of all-day calendar events</li>
</ul>
<p>I have this outputting markdown and rich text to make this easily extensible for storing the output (I send everything to <a href="https://agenda.com">Agenda</a>, but it could go to any variety of apps that can get content from Shortcuts.</p>
<p>I want to thank Alex Hay, author of the <a href="https://toolboxpro.app/">Toolbox Pro app</a> with Shortcuts actions and the <a href="https://routinehub.co/user/mralexhay">Snapshot Journal</a>. His dictionary actions to replace weather conditions with the right emoji were what I used here, and the work he’s done is brilliant.</p>
<p>And that’s the series! I’m a huge fan of the work <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com">the OmniGroup</a> has done to enable automation of OmniFocus and create more utility for its content, and have had a blast writing about and sharing some of the ways I’m using this. I’d love any and all feedback about these posts or how you’re using Shortcuts with OmniFocus!</p>
