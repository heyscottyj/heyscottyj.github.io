<p>On the last several episodes of <a href="https://nestedfolderspodcast.com">Nested Folders</a>, <a href="https://rosemaryorchard.com">Rosemary Orchard</a> and I have discussed topics that directly relate to how projects are structured.</p>
<p>Now that <a href="https://agenda.com">Agenda</a> supports both re-organization of sidebar items and the creation of projects via URL scheme (woohoo!), I have aligned my project structure between it and <a href="https://omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a>, allowing me to have consistent ways of reflecting reference and action material.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>For my own absorption of what I've done and in hopes that it inspires ideas, I thought I'd share my folder structure here. I'd love to know what everyone thinks!</p>
<h1>2020 30k</h1>
<p>This folder houses a project for each of my 2020 goals (<a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2016-Levels-of-Your-Work.pdf">Horizon 3, or the 30,000 foot horizon</a> in GTD speak), ensuring that I am regularly looking at, reflecting on, and creating actions about my goals and themes for the year. Having this folder at the top of the pile is also helpful to me in ensuring that I'm considering my themes in everything I decide to take on (or not).</p>
<h1>Brand Makers</h1>
<p>This folder holds projects at my work that are highly visible, highly important, and highly strategic. In other words, these are the projects that need particular attention, because they are the ones that I can use to elevate my brand and career.</p>
<h1>Client Projects</h1>
<p>Also for my work, these are projects my team has taken on in service of internal client needs. Most of these are production-oriented, as my team designs and builds intranet experiences.</p>
<h1>Outcome Projects</h1>
<p>Again, for my work, this is for projects that have definable outcomes but that didn't come from clients. These projects tend to be enablement-oriented, perhaps around process design, consultation, or strategy development.</p>
<h1>Properties</h1>
<p>More projects for my work! These ones are projects in that they are containers for actions, but do not have outcomes. They are single action lists in OmniFocus, with each "project" representing a different web application, site, or property that my team supports.</p>
<h1>Domains</h1>
<p>The last of my professional project folders, this one again homes never ending "projects" that represent areas of focus at work (<a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2016-Levels-of-Your-Work.pdf">Horizon 2, or the 20,000 foot altitude</a> in GTD speak). There is a list for each member of the team I support, and lists for administration, reporting, budget management, networking, etc.</p>
<h1>HeyScottyJ</h1>
<p>This folder has a mix of outcome and neverending projects related to this blog, the <a href="https://nestedfolderspodcast.com">Nested Folders</a> podcast, and several web sites I build and support. As this area of my life grows, I could see it breaking out into several folders over time, but for now, it can be contained in one, and I like seeing the totality of this aspect of my life when I look at projects there.</p>
<h1>Personal</h1>
<p>Relating to my personal life, these are outcome projects relating to my home, family, and self.</p>
<h1>Areas</h1>
<p>This is kind of the personal equivalent of Domains above, a group of never ending projects/single action lists that relate to the 20,000 foot level of my life. This would be lists for my wife, and each of my kids, home and household, car, finances, health, friends and family, and so on.</p>
<h1>Checklists</h1>
<p>This is for lists that have contain items more than actions. Some examples are lists of books to read, gifts to consider, things I might want to buy myself, foods and wines to try, and so on.</p>
<hr />
<p>And that's he breakdown of my folder structure! I like that it is flat, because I feel it is manageable enough that way, and helps me look across all my things easily.</p>
<p>I'm interested to hear if this resonates or inspires, and thank you for taking the time to read this through!</p>
