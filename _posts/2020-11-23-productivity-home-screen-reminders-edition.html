<p><a href="https://heyscottyj.com/2020/11/18/my-reimagined-productivity-home-screen/">I wrote about re-imaging my Home Screen for productivity</a>, and have gotten some tremendous feedback and ideas. Thanks everyone!</p>
<p>One thought really stuck with me: that this screen was designed around OmniFocus as a data source. This makes sense, since I use OmniFocus, and it's my screen, but what about others?</p>
<p>For those who use Reminders or Reminders-based apps like GoodTask, I have made an updated WidgetPack widget and an updated Charty rings widget.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-367 size-large aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2020/11/F6277E1E-FCB7-4653-8F6A-0095C003A74C-473x1024.jpeg" alt="" width="473" height="1024" /></p>
<p><!--more-->Now, of course I also had to fiddle with it, because I'm me, but here are some thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, my first cut had more functionality, but I was finding too many aspects distracting, so I have distilled the content more: actions and events only</li>
<li>Having events on my front page (courtesy of a more compressed heading) is really useful</li>
<li>Speaking of the header, it is now linked to the Shortcut to refresh widget content</li>
<li>Toolbox Pro actions make each Reminder shown link back to themselves in the Reminders app</li>
<li>The heading above actions (GET TO IT) links to the Shortcut to refresh the Charty ring widget (though the latest beta allows the widget to run a shortcut!)</li>
</ul>
<p>That context out of the way, the things you would need to have these widgets work:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://widgetpack.app/">WidgetPack</a></li>
<li><a href="https://chartyios.app/">Charty</a> (<a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/0z4FPzLl">1.4 TestFlight beta required</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://toolboxpro.app/">Toolbox Pro</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have those, I hope you enjoy these!</p>
