<p>It's the penultimate post in this series of Shortcuts for OmniFocus! For day four, I’m serving up a bit of a turkey of a Shortcut.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I’m highly distractable, so even when I hide the panes of OmniFocus on my iPad, I still know they’re there. This is why I built the <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/839658560afa4bc2bcdb192a20d95c0c">Inbox Processor shortcut</a>.</p>
<p>This, one by one, serves me up my inbox items from OmniFocus so that I can process and organize them in to their proper spots.</p>
<p>The catch here is that Shortcuts can’t modify OmniFocus content, so this is making new actions out of inbox items. As such, I need to delete inbox items after I’ve gone through this, and I need to go through the whole thing or else risk losing where I was at.</p>
<p>Likely, the real utility of this one is limited, but I wanted to share it anyway because it feels like one of the more creative ones I’ve done, and it might spark ideas for others around how it could be modified.</p>
<p>Hope this is helpful, and that people can also find ways to expand it!</p>
