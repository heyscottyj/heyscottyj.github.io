<p>I am (once again) in love with <a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a>, and having all my text start there.</p>
<p>While I love the idea that <a href="https://rosemaryorchard.com">Rosemary Orchard</a> had about turning on the badge in Drafts to indicate inbox items, badges amp me up too much, and so I needed a less in-the-face method of making sure these draft Drafts don't get lost.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I felt like the smoothest thing for me to do would be to have a way of scraping whatever all is in my Drafts inbox, and then indicating to me, in OmniFocus, that I have an open action about some text (otherwise it wouldn't be in my Drafts inbox!).</p>
<p>So <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/764e43712daf475d9a2d1f4ccc1ebc25">this is the Shortcut I built</a>. I figured I should share, because this seems like something others might be able to use, too.</p>
<p>Enjoy, and if you have ideas about how this might be improved, I'd be interested to hear!</p>
