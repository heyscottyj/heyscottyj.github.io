<p>The last few weeks of my career have been tough. Like, really tough.</p>
<p>We’ve all been through this. Those busy times where a project is launching but also it’s emotionally charged and also your kids have parent teacher interviews and also you’ve got a home to keep on top of and a life you want to live.</p>
<p>It’s not simple.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>But as I write this, I am deeply grateful for both <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com">Getting Things Done</a> methodologies and <a href="http://omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a>, because they, together at the centre of the massive storm of work I’ve just come through, made everything possible. Capturing my inputs, clarifying their meaning, organizing the outcomes and commitments in to a system I can then review and engage with not only kept me sane, but made me successful.</p>
<p>With all of this in mind, I’m excited to use this platform to start sharing the experiences I’ve had and knowledge I’ve collected over the last decade plus of GTD use and the last five years with OmniFocus. I’ll probably write about other productivity-related things, too. Who knows.</p>
<p>I’m not entirely sure how this blog will unfold or what it will become. I only know that writing this post was my next action to getting going. So here it is.</p>
<p>Tick.</p>
