<p>Earlier this year, I had the great pleasure of working with Tim Stringer of <a href="https://learnomnifocus.com/?ref=20">Learn OmniFocus</a> to <a href="https://learnomnifocus.com/tutorials/2019-02-20-omnifocus-3-workflows-with-scotty-jackson?ref=20">present my workflows</a> and <a href="https://omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a> set up.</p>
<p><!--more-->It was an amazing experience, and I wanted to re-share it for everyone's consumption. As always, I'd love to hear feedback, as I love learning from all the other contributors to <a href="https://learnomnifocus.com/?ref=20">Learn OmniFocus</a> and the OmniFocus community writ large.</p>

<p><em>Note that the links I've used to Learn OmniFocus are affiliate links. My session was done before I was an affiliate, though, and I'd happily promote this either way. They're awesome and absolutely worth checking out.</em></p>
