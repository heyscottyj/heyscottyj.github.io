<p>I've <a href="https://heyscottyj.com/2019/11/25/day-one-five-days-of-omnifocus-shortcuts/#more-163">written before about a Boss Review Shortcut</a>, a way to make it easier for me to prepare for meetings with my boss at work, but I have since expanded this to work with members of my team as well. I also had a great time <a href="https://www.relay.fm/automators/49">discussing this with David Sparks and Rosemary Orchard on Automators episode 49.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/90a4b3959bfd4c2ba3e830049bfe4486">This 1-1 Prep Email Shortcut</a> presents a dictionary of people choices, allows me to pick, and then finds anything tagged with their name in OmniFocus to build an email to them around.</p>
<p>Taken further (but less easily shared with all of you here), this could be connected to a reusable Data Jar dictionary, <a href="https://heyscottyj.com/2020/05/05/automating-emails-with-data-jar/">like I've talked about in a previous post</a>. A great way to ensure consistency in data, as well as to update existing Shortcuts quickly with new team members, and a huge time saver in exploring potential new Shortcuts.</p>
