<p>On <a href="https://nestedfolderspodcast.com/podcast/episode-5-how-we-weekly-review/">this week's episode of the Nested Folders podcast</a>, <a href="https://rosemaryorchard.com">Rosemary Orchard</a> and I discussed our approaches to reflection and review of our productivity systems.</p>

<p>One of my keys here has been taking the <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GTD-WeeklyReview.pdf">traditional Getting Things Done weekly review checklist</a>, and splitting it in to two parts:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reflection Friday</strong>: doing the Getting Clear portion in its entirety, and then doing the calendar review parts of Getting Current to ensure all things I might capture in my system are well-inventoried. The goal is to make sure I have a current capture of all the things.</li>
<li><strong>Executive Monday</strong>: inspired by <a href="https://kadavy.net/blog/posts/prefrontal-mondays/">David Kadavy's Prefrontal Mondays</a>, this part of my review completes Getting Current and Getting Creative and Courageous by taking a more executive-level view of lists, projects, and actions to decide what I <em>do</em> about all the things I've captured. This is 100% decision-makign time about what I focus on, defer, delegate, delete, rename, adjust, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>This has been hugely helpful for me - what are your practices?</p>

<p>I also want to quickly give a shoutout to James Dempsy and Jean MacDonald and their <a href="https://theweeklyreview.fm">The Weekly Review Podcast</a>, which not only gave this an anthem (I hear the song every time I say the words), but also a lot of awesome and robust thinking on this topic. Great stuff!</p>
