<p>I am loving using the iOS 14 widgets to keep a clear eye on my day, and with <a href="https://chartyios.app">Charty</a> and its (beta) widgets and data views, I have been able to craft iOS Shortcuts that display really useful data on my homescreen.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-316 size-large" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2020/09/0AF70361-9AF5-4C4B-8D94-4E4C791AD9A2-473x1024.jpeg" alt="" width="473" height="1024" /></p>
<p><!--more-->I have two charts that I love, each drawing on my <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a> data to quickly display useful things:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>OmniDay</strong>: this uses the data view to give me a list of counts of actions I need to be on top of. The Shortcut that generates this chart <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e046cf14a43d4688aac650f21199b07e">can be downloaded here</a>.
<ul>
<li>üöÄ <strong>Action</strong>, a total of:</li>
<li>‚è∞ <strong>Due</strong> actions available</li>
<li>üéè <strong>Flagged</strong> actions available</li>
<li>‚≠êÔ∏è <strong>Forecast-tagged</strong> actions available</li>
<li>‚òëÔ∏è <strong>Completed</strong> items today</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>OmniWeek</strong>: this graphs a chart of actions completed today (‚òÜ), and in the six previous days leading up to today. The Shortcut that generates this chart <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/040fc5a1f6164403b95e8b33045dd523">can be downloaded here</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>With these charts generated, it's a matter of adding the Charty widgets to a home screen. For bonus marks, I made a third Shortcut called "Refresh Charts", which just runs the two shortcuts above. I added it as a widget in a stack "behind" the OmniDay data, ensuring I can always quickly update the views.</p>
<p>I hope someone finds this useful and enjoys! Would love to hear what folks think.</p>
