<p>Need to do some last minute holiday shopping? I know I do. Thankfully, I have a workflow for how I approach gift giving, powered by <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote earlier about how I use OmniFocus for <a href="https://heyscottyj.com/2018/12/04/omnifocus-for-the-holidays/">organizing my holiday experience</a>, but in response to a reader question, I thought I’d expand on my gift management workflow.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I know many aren’t fans of keeping checklists or “non-tasks” in OmniFocus, but for me, I find a lot of these sorts of things become actionable over time, so having such things stored in OmniFocus is valuable.</p>
<p>Examples of these lists are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gifts</li>
<li>Things (like gifts, but for me)</li>
<li>Books to Read</li>
<li>Food and Drink to Try</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are great inspirations when it comes to figuring out what I might need to do for holiday shopping.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, I collect ideas in these lists as actions, usually tagged <code>Someday/Maybe</code> (which puts them on hold) and with the name of the intended recipient. For bonus marks, I might also add a note of where/why I heard of this as well as where to find it. For books in particular, I like to also note who recommended it (so that I can thank or blame them later).</p>
<p>This creates a great inventory of ideas. As events come up (birthdays or holidays), I can look at those lists, remove the <code>Someday/Maybe</code> tag, and assign the actions to a new project that it could belong to (such as “Christmas Shopping” or “Wife’s Birthday”).</p>
<p>As I move these actions, I can add “Buy” to the action’s name, and then tag it with an <code>Errand</code> tag (with location perhaps). If an online purchase, I can use the same action to track the order and shipment, too (with a <code>Waiting For</code> tag and a link to the shipment tracking).</p>
<p>Having a bank of potentially actionable ideas that I can then turn in to actions in the appropriate project has been a boon to my gift-giving game. What do you use to track ideas and purchases?</p>
