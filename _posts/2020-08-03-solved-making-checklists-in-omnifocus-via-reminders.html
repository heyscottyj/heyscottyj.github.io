<p>One of the features I wish <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a> had was the ability to add checklists. As an example, I need to go through a morning routine of four items every morning, but having four discrete actions in OmniFocus feels a little clutterful, and having a badge that reads <strong>4</strong> seems inappropriate.</p>
<p>There are other use cases, of course, where a number of steps represented by a single task makes sense to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do my weekly review</li>
<li>Complete post-production on <a href="https://nestedfolderspodcast.com">Nested Folders</a> episode</li>
<li>Make bread in the bread maker</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to iOS Shortcuts, the amazing <a href="https://toolboxpro.app">Toolbox Pro</a> actions for it, and some internet research, <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/43647381ec674cf09b3446ed92ca55f0">I have come up with a solution</a> that creates a single task in OmniFocus, a list in Reminders with the same name, and the steps laid out in that list, which is linked to from the note of the OmniFocus task.</p>
<p>It's a little bit hacky, but I think this help me keep my OmniFocus actions focused (ha), while giving the discrete steps to my actions a safe home for reuse.</p>
<p>Interested to hear if others find this useful!</p>
