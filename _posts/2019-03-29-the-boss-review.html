<p>A weekly status review on projects with one’s boss tends to be part of having a job, and I was recently asked about how I use OmniFocus and Agenda for this process. It was a great question, because it made me think about my workflow so that I am optimizing for both:</p>
<ol>
<li>Simplicity - having the right amount of detail and ease of execution</li>
<li>The audience - making sure my workflow makes it easy for my boss to consume the content I’m offering up</li>
</ol>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>This isn’t super tricky, but it does require some thoughtfulness to make sure that I’m not optimizing for one at the expense of another.</p>
<p>The key ingredients here are my apps of choice:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a></li>
<li><a href="https://agenda.com">Agenda</a></li>
<li>Calendar (I use the stock app)</li>
<li><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios">iOS Shortcuts</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I've optimized my workflow for iOS (obvs, since Shortcuts). I usually use my iPad, but have show screens below from my iPhone, since that's smaller and just as possible.</p>
<p>I’ve broken up my workflow into the following five steps, which I think get me to a positive place for overall outcomes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create the list of things in OmniFocus</strong>: I start with what I want to review by having a perspective in OmniFocus that includes specifically chosen projects:<img class=" size-full wp-image-74 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2019/03/F3549848-439E-4F0C-89EE-0007A4E74CE4.png" alt="F3549848-439E-4F0C-89EE-0007A4E74CE4.png" width="1125" height="2436" /></li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>I copy the projects to be discussed</strong>: Using my OF perspective, I copy the projects to discuss with my boss:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Convert this OF list into a text list</strong>: I use <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4c7f2e4568db4d668e9180c2086511d9">this iOS Shortcut</a>, into which I paste the copied OF into for conversion to a nice text list (copied to clipboard). It includes only project names, as I’d like the discussion to be what shares appropriate detail, and not the list itself. I just want this to be a stage-setting of topics.</li>
<li><strong>Paste this new list as an agenda into the meeting calendar event</strong>: By putting this content in to our calendar meeting request, I can be assured that the content is in the most appropriate place for both of us to reference before and during our meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Create a note in Agenda</strong>: I create a new note in Agenda and link to the meeting with my boss. This gives the note the appropriate time/date, a bit of a temporal audit trail, and sucks in the agenda (pun) that I put in the calendar request as a framework for me to take notes against.</li>
<li><strong>We hold the meeting</strong>: I refer to my OF perspective with the projects worth talking about, using those projects’ actions as context (ha) for the discussion. I make notes of what we talk about in the Agenda note, and identify follow-up actions in the note as checklist items.</li>
<li><strong>I process the meeting</strong>: Running my favourite <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ebc1613df9874f5e9e5b510702d96265">iOS Shortcut</a>, I process the notes I took into OF as actions to follow up on and into an email to my boss so that we have a shared understanding of everything discussed. It also gives my boss an open platform to correct anything I might have missed or misunderstood.</li>
<li><strong>I do the actions I said I would</strong>: Because commitments.</li>
</ol>
<p>That sums up my process, bit by bit and piece by piece. Interested to hear from comments how this could be improved, or what you’ve found really works for you!</p>
