<p>On the <a href="https://nestedfolderspodcast.com/podcast/episode-18-breaking-perfectionist-blocks/">Breaking Perfectionist Blocks episode of Nested Folders</a>, <a href="https://rosemaryorchard.com">Rosemary Orchard</a> and I spitballed an idea to quickly generate a random list of three OmniFocus actions meeting a specific criteria (in our case, a tag).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/788f84c4d27b457b9f73092b8adc2d43">Here is an iOS Shortcut</a> that accomplishes exactly that. Enjoy!</p>
