<p><strong>Update</strong>: just fixed a minor bug in refresh for Flagged and Forecast-Tagged widgets - links updated below!</p>
<p>Thank you everyone for the tremendous support of my first cut at making widgets for <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a> with <a href="https://widgetpack.app">WidgetPack</a>! I know I am finding them super helpful.</p>
<p>After spending some time using them, learning more about <a href="https://widgetpack.app">WidgetPack</a>, and agonizing over design decisions (padding and spacing matters), I have made new versions of the widgets with better utility and visual appeal.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-333" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2020/10/PNG-image-2-292x300.png" alt="Due Widget for OmniFocus" width="486" height="500" /></p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Here's what's new:</p>
<ul>
<li>any OF task displayed actually links to that task inside OF so that you could see its notes, edit it, mark it complete, drop it or whatever</li>
<li>the design specifically only shows a maximum of four actions (this was brutal, but necessary to allow for space for longer task names and still look good)</li>
<li>a count of relevant undisplayed tasks is shown at the bottom of the widget, linked to the relevant perspective (Forecast Today for the due and forecast-tagged widgets, and Flagged for the flagged widget)</li>
<li>a colour-coordinated button has been added to each widget to drive right to adding a new task in OF (like quick entry, not automatically assuming a due date or flagged state)</li>
<li>a colour-coordinated refresh button to run the shortcut that makes it to update widget contents</li>
<li>dark mode support, so that the widget respects system state of dark mode</li>
<li>as referred to above, optimized spacing, layout, and sizing of elements</li>
<li>comments in the top section to enable anyone to (fairly easily?) customize the widget with choices for the accent colour, title, SF symbol, and link to open OF with</li>
</ul>
<p>And the shortcuts are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/359d56efd8f4438fa46243137561958f">Due</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/66d94ac40edf463495e02e73cab482a3">Flagged</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2ea5fb21060745fcb35f5d1f25f8365a">Forecast-tagged</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These have all really been oriented for large size widgets which I think makes sense, based on the amount of content. Running a shortcut here will create the widget in WidgetPack, so adding a WidgetPack widget to your screen and then editing it to point at the widget you've made will do the trick.</p>
<p>I'll admit that the shortcuts take a bit of time to run, but I don't know if it's worth putting in a lot of work to try to optimize; I know <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/whats-new-with-ios-and-ipados-14">the Omni Team is working hard on real native widgets</a> that would be, I'm sure, much more efficient than these.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy, please keep sharing feedback and thoughts!</p>
