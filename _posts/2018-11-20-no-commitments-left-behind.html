<p>I’m a meetings guy. Largely not by choice, but a lot of my work day is meetings.</p>
<p>One of the biggest traps of meetings is that, unless they are very well facilitated (spoiler alert: many aren’t), it gets really easy for agreements or commitments to be made but then later lost or never acted on.</p>
<p>After all, saying stuff is easy.</p>
<p>I’ve found just the right solution to this that works for me, though, and so I wanted to write about it.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>It was only a few months ago that I discovered <a href="https://agenda.com">Agenda</a> which, after I’d spent a great deal of time looking for a solid note-taking/storing app, was a great relief.</p>
<p>Agenda’s main conceit is that each note belongs not only to a project (which in turn belongs to a category for organization nirvana), but can also be linked to a date or specific calendar event. In this way, content is searchable by topics and times, giving me multidimensional control over how my content is arranged.</p>
<p>Moreover, Agenda, though it writes in its own kind of editor experience, can export content in Markdown, making it wildly recyclable and reusable.</p>
<p>All of this adds up to my ability to take great thoughtstream-based notes that link to meetings that clearly identify notes and actions/commitments.</p>
<p>The magic happens, though, when I share Markdown from Agenda to <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/d939c6944a5b42aba958d4517b06d2d4">this iOS Shortcut I built</a>. That shortcut takes the Markdown from Agenda, identifies lines that are actions, pastes them to <a href="https://omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> (since they get converted to TaskPaper format), and then organizes an email I can then send to all participants.</p>
<p>In this way, I can store content for later reference in Agenda, track the actions through OmniFocus, and create a trail of agreement by sharing all of this.</p>
<p>So as easy as it might be to say things, this means everything said really means something. Nothing lost, nothing left behind.</p>
<p>And that’s something.</p>
