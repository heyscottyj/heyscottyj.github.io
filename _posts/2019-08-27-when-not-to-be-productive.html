<p>On <a href="https://nestedfolderspodcast.com/podcast/episode-4-when-not-to-be-productive/">this week's Nested Folders podcast episode</a>, Rose and I talked about when not to be productive. In thinking about this even more, there's a second quote from <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/11/28/productive-talk-comp">the Merlin Mann interview with David Allen</a> that I really like, which is to have a great list of things to have in order to procrastinate with. That is, stuff you can do to "safely" avoid doing other things.</p>
<p>This is where some of my favourite lists come in. I thought I'd share them here, along with how I use them:</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Books to Read</strong>: I always include the reason why this is on my list (where I saw it, or who recommended it), and why I thought it would be a good go-to. This keeps better context about why it's on my list, and who to thank/blame later.</li>
<li><strong>Curiosities</strong>: Articles of interest, YouTube videos, or other bits of media that I think would be of interest or good to learn from in a time-killing kind of situation.</li>
<li><strong>Ping</strong>: A group of recurring actions to remind me to reach out to people I don't interact with regularly to keep our connections going. Catching up with friends is a great way to be unproductive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are some of my favourite “unproductive“ lists; what are yours?</p>
