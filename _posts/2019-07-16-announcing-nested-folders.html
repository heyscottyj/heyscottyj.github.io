<p>After several months of discussion, planning, preparation, and writing, I am so proud to announce that I have partnered with the wonderful and talented <a href="https://rosemaryorchard.com">Rosemary Orchard</a> to co-produce the <a href="https://nestedfolderspodcast.com/">Nested Folders Podcast</a>!</p>
<p>We’ll discuss all manners of productivity topics, mostly centres around philosophies, techniques, and approaches, so that listeners can benefit from our experiences, regardless of apps or systems they might use.</p>
<p>We’re just starting out, and no doubt we’ll iterate and improve, but I am very excited to share and learn through this new podcast, and would love to hear any and all feedback from everyone!</p>
<p>Also, a huge thanks and shout out to <a href="https://josh-hughes.com">Josh Hughes</a> for the amazing cover art. Love this!</p>
