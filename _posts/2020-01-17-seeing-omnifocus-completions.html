<p>There was a question on the <a href="https://discourse.omnigroup.com/c/omnifocus">OmniGroup Discourse Forums</a> the other day about seeing completed items in OmniFocus, but just the last two days' worth. While this can't be done with Perspectives, it can be accomplished with the new Shortcuts integrations.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/02c2acb871b046058c8a45f8e0927740">Completed Items</a> Shortcut creates a list of all OmniFocus items completed over the last two calendar days, sorted by completion time. While it just offers a Quick Look at that list, it could easily be modified to output text to the destination of your choice.</p>
<p>Thought I'd share, as I'm experimenting with journaling and logging my accomplishments. Enjoy!</p>
