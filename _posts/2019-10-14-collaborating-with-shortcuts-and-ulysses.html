<p>On lucky <a href="https://nestedfolderspodcast.com/podcast/how-to-do-productivity-with-others-who-may-or-may-not/">episode 7</a> of the <a href="https://nestedfolderspodcast.com">Nested Folders Podcast</a>, <a href="https://rosemaryorchard.com/">Rose Orchard</a> and I discussed how we “do productivity” with others who might or might not, and a lot of this really has to do with communication.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One thing Rose brought up was the importance of meeting notes and sharing them, so I thought I’d post about how I do this with Shortcuts and Ulysses.</p>

<p>I have two Shortcuts that I use. The first (aptly called <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4f8f087212ea46749040ce7b26d36a0a">Start Meeting</a>) sets me up with a Ulysses sheet that guides me to take notes, capture actions, and record agreements.</p>

<p>The second (reasonably called <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/22fd3f782bd14c4abdf070f7334dff5c">End Meeting</a>, and run by sharing markdown text from the Ulysses sheet) takes those notes and sends them to the attendees, ensuring everyone has access to my perspective of what just happened, and might also share theirs.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>I'd love feedback or improvement ideas for these Shortcuts and this workflow!</p>
