<p>One of the things I wanted to make easier was how to build a new action in <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> based on an existing action. If I'm in Forecast, for example, and am completing an action, maybe I want to make a new action in that project quickly and easily.</p>

<p>I made <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b66e772a495242cc85359a2b70a59b57">a Next Action Shortcut</a> for exactly this. It works by sharing an action in OmniFocus to it, then asks for a name for the new action, and then adds an action named that to the shared action's project. For bonus marks, it adds a note to the new action showing what action it was created from, a link to that action, and that action's note.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
