<p>I had a blast writing about Shortcuts with OmniFocus 3.4 last week, but based on <a href="https://heyscottyj.com/2019/11/29/day-five-the-daily-journal-five-days-of-omnifocus-shortcuts/#comments">reader Jason Clarke's feedback</a>, I think it would be good to round out my Daily Journal Shortcut with a bit more detail, as well as a second partner Shortcut that leverages it.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>My <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/095ed952bcb44ae4bbe8d3d31a702749">Daily Agenda Journal Shortcut</a> (based on the <a href="https://heyscottyj.com/2019/11/29/day-five-the-daily-journal-five-days-of-omnifocus-shortcuts/">Daily Journal Shortcut</a> I shared last week) connects <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/ios/">OmniFocus</a> data (due/overdue, flag and available, and Forecast-tagged and available actions) with calendar and weather data to create a note in <a href="https://agenda.com">Agenda</a>.</p>
<p>What I love about using <a href="https://agenda.com">Agenda</a> for this is that the way its x-callback-urls are constructed (making and opening notes based on titles), I can know the URL to open a given note before I even make it.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I also have a <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/57df02b45422433594965469cd2830ee">Today Shortcut</a>, whose sole job is to open today's entry in my daily journal in Agenda for referencing throughout the day. This is a great way to make sure I am maximizing the value of the journal entries.</p>
<p>Thanks to Jason for the feedback, and hope this extended version of the Shortcut is valuable for all!</p>
