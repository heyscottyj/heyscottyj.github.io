<p>On <a href="https://nestedfolderspodcast.com/podcast/episode-12-actions-vs-reference/">episode 12 of the Nested Folders podcast, Actions vs. Reference</a>, I mentioned a shortcut to create projects in both Agenda and OmniFocus. This is awesome, because it allows me to have complementary and align organizational structures for both action/task management and reference material.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2f36b7c50c8848b6b598e421d0531d8c">Here is the proof of concept Shortcut, Project Maker</a>, which creates a project in OmniFocus and task to review and add to the project (which links to Agenda), as well as a project in Agenda with a note that links back to OmniFocus.</p>
<p>Certainly, this could be expanded by tying in input from your workflow as the project, defining more tasks/note content, and specifying folders/categories for projects to be placed in.</p>
<p>How might you improve this Shortcut?</p>
<p>In an upcoming post, I will share my current folder/category structure as a way of documenting how I decide what projects go where. I'm looking forward to it!</p>
