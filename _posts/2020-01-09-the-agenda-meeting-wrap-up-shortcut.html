<p>In the past, I have written about <a href="https://heyscottyj.com/2018/12/17/my-agenda-action-workflow/">my Agenda and OmniFocus workflow</a>. Today, I'm excited to share an update to my Shortcut.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Now called the <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/6cc74ed6074a4f778097202174f89ff4">Agenda Meeting Wrap-Up</a>, this Shortcut still does the same things:</p>
<ul>
<li>parses shared Markdown from Agenda to find both actions and completed actions</li>
<li>provides the option to move those actions to an OmniFocus project for action management</li>
<li>appends a link to the OmniFocus project in the shared Agenda note</li>
<li>provides the option to email the contents of the note, with actions collected together, to meeting participants</li>
<li>the email will pre-populate with recipients based on a lookup of the Agenda note to calendar events and getting a match's attendees (so it's good to use the Agenda "Link to Event" feature)</li>
</ul>
<p>This corrects defects in the previous version of the Shortcut introduced by iOS 13 and other application changes. It also stops action content from landing on the clipboard.</p>
<p>Enjoy! I'd love to hear what you think and if this is helpful!</p>
