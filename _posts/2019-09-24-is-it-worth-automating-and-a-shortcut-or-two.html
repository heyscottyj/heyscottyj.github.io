<p>On <a href="https://nestedfolderspodcast.com/podcast/episode-6-is-it-worth-automating/">this week's episode of the Nested Folders podcast</a>, <a href="https://rosemaryorchard.com">Rosemary Orchard</a> and I discussed automation as a solution, and when it should be employed.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We didn't really answer the question, but I think we shared a lot that one could think about when considering the prospect of automation. Also, I wanted to share the couple of Shortcuts I have that take care of my favourite annoyances.</p>

<li><strong>Strip Formatting</strong>: <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/6a4a59f27eed40c7acb7ceea03d05184">this shortcut</a> takes the clipboard, gets the text (only) form the input, then copies that text back to the clipboard, thereby removing any formatting.</li>
<li><strong>Telescrum</strong>: my team at work works in agile, and we sometimes conduct our daily scrum via Slack if there are conflicting events or only few of us around. <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/bfa08350ce1d4bc1b8ea9f0612c0b0e7">This shortcut</a> grabs my calendar for the previous work day and today and creates a list on my clipboard that I can paste in to our channel (no direct Shortcuts to Slack integration yet). This probably needs some editing to work for you, but is hopefully inspirational.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm looking forward to sharing some more Shortcuts soon, just as soon as soon as a few app updates ship publicly. ðŸ˜‰</p>
