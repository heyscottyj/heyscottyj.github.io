<p>In a <a href="https://heyscottyj.com/2018/11/20/no-commitments-left-behind/">previous post</a>, I wrote about my iOS Shortcut that connects <a href="https://agenda.com">Agenda</a> to <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/ios/">OmniFocus</a>. With thanks to everyone for their questions, I wanted to follow up with some additional details around how I use the Shortcut and what my workflow is like.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>This is all surrounding the fact that I attend a lot of meetings, so the goals here are to:</p>
<ol>
<li>set myself up to take good meeting notes</li>
<li>store these notes for later reference</li>
<li>peel out and handle the actions arising from the meeting</li>
<li>share all of the above with the other attendees</li>
</ol>
<p>This sounds like a lot, but this is why automation is awesome.</p>
<p>I’ll start off by making a new note in Agenda and <a href="https://agenda.community/t/dates-and-events/53">linking it to the appropriate meeting in my calendar</a>. This brings over text from the event that might be relevant, and also gives the note a temporal assignment (my favourite part of Agenda is how things get dated by when they happen, and not necessarily when they are created/edited).</p>
<p>During the meeting, I take notes as bullets, and identify actions as checklist items:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-59" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2018/12/431DE12A-9B7B-4C2A-8D8F-9E24E30B718B-162964393-1545059504473.jpeg" alt="431DE12A-9B7B-4C2A-8D8F-9E24E30B718B-162964393-1545059472102.jpeg" width="1125" height="1815" /></p>
<p>At the end of the meeting, I use the Share function to send the Markdown (this is a premium feature of Agenda) to my <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/d939c6944a5b42aba958d4517b06d2d4">Process Meeting Notes</a> iOS Shortcut.</p>
<p>This does a couple of things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It creates a project in OmniFocus called “Complete Actions from ”, including each action in the note and an additional flagged action (<code>Review these actions for contexts, due and defer dates, or other needs</code>) to draw my attention to the project:
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-60" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2018/12/D705E9C2-4333-4173-91B7-F1C2A6B53A1A-2331201378-1545059536193.jpeg" alt="D705E9C2-4333-4173-91B7-F1C2A6B53A1A.jpeg" width="1125" height="830" /></li>
<li>It starts an email to whomever I like, using the title of the note prefaced by “[NOTES]:” as the subject line. The body of the email is the notes but with action items (and completed actions) grouped under a heading:
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-63" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2018/12/78B99C7F-DC4C-4083-A638-51A983609FDC-2821003988-1545062687146.jpeg" alt="78B99C7F-DC4C-4083-A638-51A983609FDC" width="1125" height="2171" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-62" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2018/12/BBDF4C8D-6D64-4DAD-AE9F-842FCB8211E7-991526252-1545059760571.jpeg" alt="BBDF4C8D-6D64-4DAD-AE9F-842FCB8211E7.jpeg" width="1125" height="2120" /></li>
</ol>
<p>This workflow is a massive timesaver for me, and also helps me to manage commitments with others, while also helping others to also be aware of how I perceive both their commitments and my own.</p>
<p>Also, I meet all four of those goals with one note and one Shortcut. Not shabby.</p>
